					<h2>What is GIT?</h2>
					<p>
						A distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. Git is a free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
					</p>

					<h3>HISTORY OF GIT</h3>
					<P>
					   Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source control management (SCM) system that they had previously used to maintain the project.[11] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper protocols

					<h2>what a VCS is?</h2>
					<p>
						-Allows developers to work simultaneously.
                        -Does not allow overwriting each other’s changes.
                        -Maintains a history of every version.
                    </p>

                	<h2>Distributed Version Control System</h2>
                    <p>
                    	Distributed version control, also known as distributed revision control or decentralized version control, allows many software developers to work on a given project without requiring them to share a common network. The software revisions are stored in a distributed revision control system (DRCS), also known as a distributed version control system (DVCS).

					<h2>Advantages of Git</h2>
					<p>
					  -Free and open source
					  -Fast and small
					  -Implicit backup
					  -Security
					  -No need of powerful hardware
                      -Easier branching

                <section>
                	<h2>What is github?</h2>
                	<p>GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service.It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.It provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.GitHub offers both plans for private repositories and free accounts,which are usually used to host open-source software projects.
                	</p>

                <section>
                	<h2>Differnce between Git and Github</h2>
                	<p>
                		Git is the distributed version control system. Git is responsible for keeping track of changes to content (usually source code files), and it provides mechanisms for sharing that content with others.

                        GitHub is a company that provides Git repository hosting. If your team has a shared repository on GitHub, you could conceivably use GitHub without ever looking at its website. But, the website provides a lot of value on top of the core Git repository.
 
                        Concepts from Git: Repositories, branches, remotes, committing, pushing, pulling, merging, rebasing, reverting, and cherry-picking.

                        Concepts from GitHub: Pull requests, issues, wikis, forking someone else's repository, Gists, github.com.
